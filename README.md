# About

Stopwatch is my first ever project in Java. It uses core concepts of Java like event Handling and Multi-Threading for implementing a  stopwatch with features like  reset, lap, current date and time, precision upto  mili seconds. In short it is a perfect stopwatch for day to day use.

# How to run

StopWatch project conatains two classes newThread.java and
StopWatch.java. To run this project use class newThread.java
as the main class.

A jar file is now added in build/classes under the name of 
StopWatch.jar one can directly run the StopWatch using this jar 
file. On windows one can directly run Stopwatch just by double
clicking on StopWatch.jar file.
